For a number of reasons, I've recently set up a new PGP key
and will be transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for a short period after
the posting of this message, but future signatures will be
created from the new key. This message is signed by both keys
to certify the transition.


The old key was:

    pub  2048R/4D46BBB6 2013-08-12
	 Fingerprint=E564 CB19 8CF2 877C 587D  069F B929 5DFF 4D46 BBB6

The new key is:

    pub  4096R/3910CDC8 2016-04-06
        Fingerprint=F98D F8BD 5B57 F40F 1CD3  55E8 F883 FF08 3910 CDC8

Note that the signing of this message may have been done by a SUBKEY of
that key, which may make the key id listed in the signature not match
the fingerprint listed here. You can verify it by checking the key listed
here for the subkey used in signing this message.

To fetch the new key from a public key server, you can use the following:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 3910CDC8

If you already know my old key, you can verify that the new key has been
signed by the old one, so the trail of signatures can still be followed:

    gpg --check-sigs 3910CDC8

If you don't know my old key, or you want to be extra careful, you can
check the fingerprint against the one above:

    gpg --fingerprint 3910CDC8

You can verify the signatures on this message by downloading the plain
text file as linked and running:

    gpg --verify [name of downloaded file]

If you are satisfied that you have the right key, that the UIDs match what
you expect, and you are certain of my identity, I would appreciate it if
you would sign my new key:

    gpg --sign-key 3910CDC8

And finally, if you have signed it, to upload the signatures:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 3910CDC8

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Regards,

    --thenaterhood
